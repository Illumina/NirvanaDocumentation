## Overview

Primate AI is a deep residual neural network for classifying the pathogenicity of missense mutations.

The newer version, PrimateAI-3D, uses a 3D convolutional neural network, to predict protein variant pathogenicity using structural information.
The model's innovative use of primate sequencing and structural data offers promising insights into variant interpretation and disease gene identification.
The predictive score range between 0 and 1, with 0 being benign and 1 being most pathogenic.

Primate AI is available in two versions based on assembly:
1. Primate AI 3D: Only available for GRCh38
1. Primate AI: Only available for GRCh37

Both have different file structures, and information. Therefore, they are handled separately:

### Parsing

#### CSV File

```scss
,chr,pos,non_flipped_ref,non_flipped_alt,gene_name,change_position_1based,ref_aa,alt_aa,score_PAI3D,percentile_PAI3D,refseq
0,chr1,69094,G,A,ENST00000335137.4,2,V,M,0.6169436463713646,0.5200308441794135,NM_001005484.1

```

From the CSV file, all columns are parsed:
* `chr`
* `pos`
* `ref`
* `alt`
* `gene_name`
* `change_position_1based`
* `ref_aa`
* `alt_aa`
* `score_PAI3D`
* `percentile_PAI3D`
* `refseq`

The fields `gene_name` and `refseq` define the Ensembl and RefSeq transcript IDs respectively.
These transcripts are passed as-is and some of them might be unrecognized/deprecated by RefSeq/Ensembl.

#### Parsing Command
```shell
dotnet SAUtils.dll \
PrimateAi \
--r "${References}/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.Nirvana.dat" \
--i "${ExternalDataSources}/PrimateAI/3D/PAI3D_wholeProteome_23_04_11.percentiles.pkg.refseq.csv.gz" \
--o "${SaUtilsOutput]"
```


### Known Issues

:::caution Known Issues
Some transcript IDs defined in the data file are obsolete, retired, or updated.
They are not removed or modified by Illumina Annotator, and are passed as-is from the PrimateAI-3D data source.

#### Example:
**ENST00000643905.1** transcript is retired according to [Ensembl](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Transcript/Idhistory?db=core;t=ENST00000643905)

**NM_182838.2** transcript is removed because it is a pseudo-gene according to [RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_182838.3)

### Parsing

#### TSV File

```scss
chr	pos	ref	alt	refAA	altAA	strand_1pos_0neg	trinucleotide_context	UCSC_gene	ExAC_coverage	primateDL_score
chr10	1046704	C	T	R	C	1	CCG	uc001ift.3	45.49	0.849114537239
chr10	1046704	C	G	R	G	1	CCG	uc001ift.3	45.49	0.795686006546
```

From the TSV file, we're mainly interested in the following columns:
* `chr`
* `pos`
* `ref`
* `alt`
* `primateDL_score`

We also use `UCSC_gene` to filter out variants that don't have matching gene models in Illumina Annotator.

### Pre-processing

#### Converting UCSC IDs

Primate AI only provides UCSC IDs. As an initial pre-processing step, we'll need to convert these to either Entrez or Ensembl Gene IDs.

The following queries are used to download the conversions from UCSC:

```bash
mysql -h genome-mysql.soe.ucsc.edu -u genome -A -P 3306 \
      -e "select * FROM knownToLocusLink;" hg19 > ucsc_locuslink.tsv

mysql -h genome-mysql.soe.ucsc.edu -u genome -A -P 3306 \
      -e "select knownToEnsembl.name, knownToEnsembl.value, ensGene.name2 FROM knownToEnsembl, ensGene WHERE knownToEnsembl.value = ensGene.name;" \
      hg19 > ucsc_ensembl.tsv
```

#### Running the Pre-Processor

The Primate AI pre-processor can be run as follows:

```bash
dotnet PrimateAiPreProcessor.dll UGA_develop.tsv PrimateAI_scores_v0.2.tsv.gz \
     ucsc_locuslink.tsv ucsc_ensembl.tsv PrimateAI_0.2_GRCh37.tsv.gz
```

During conversion, 0.5% of the UCSC Ids cannot be converted to either Entrez or Ensembl gene IDs. Once the gene IDs have been acquired, we check to see which are available in Illumina Annotator.

The following Entrez Gene IDs were not found:

```scss
399753
401980
504189
504191
100293534
```

Here is the output from the pre-processor:

```scss
- loading UCSC to Entrez Gene ID dictionary... 73,432 genes loaded.
- loading UCSC to Ensembl Gene ID dictionary... 76,178 genes loaded.
- loading UGA gene ID to gene dictionary... 103,277 genes loaded.
- parsing Primate AI variants... 70,121,953 variants parsed.

# variants with unknown gene ID: 27,253 / 70,121,953
# genes with unknown gene ID:    109 / 19,614

# variants not in UGA: 2,036 / 70,121,953
# genes not in UGA:    6 / 19,614
```

### Known Issues

:::caution Known Issues
The Primate AI data set provides raw scores, but the scores are biased according to gene context. I.e. a 0.4 means something different in `TP53` than it does in `KRAS`.

As a result, the Primate AI team provided guidance on aggregating these scores and presenting them as percentiles with respect to the associated gene. According to their research, the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile is a good proxy for benign variants and the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile is a good proxy for pathogenic variants.
